### [ LEGEND FILE ] ###

My Defender has a default map, but you can specify a map file of your choice 
in the command line arguments: 

    ./my_defender [map path]

The map must be 32 characters wide and 16 tall. Any further character won't be 
taken in consideration. The map must have at least :
    - a tower, made of 3x3 tiles
    - a road starting from the very right side, and going to the tower

## TILES ##

    '#' - GRASS
    'O' - TOWER
